One of the easiest and most ignored thing to do, in order to boost up the performance of our JavaScript applications, is to learn how to write properly high performant loop statements. The idea of this article is to help with that.


>_We will see the main types of loops used in JavaScript and how can we write them in a performant way._

## LOOP PERFORMANCE
When it comes to loop performance, the debate is always about which loop to use. Which is the fastest and most performant? The truth is, that, of the four loop types provided by JavaScript, only one of them is significantly slower than the othersâ€Š-â€Š```for-in``` loop. _The choice of loop type should be based on your requirements rather than performance concerns_.

>_There are two main factors that contribute to loop performanceâ€Š-â€Šwork done per iteration and number of iterations._

In the sections below we will see how by decreasing them, we can have a positive overall impact to the loop performance.

## For Loop
ECMA-262, 3rd Edition, the specification that defines JavaScript's basic syntax and behavior, defines four types of loops. The first is the standard ```for``` loop, which shares its syntax with other C-like languages:

```jsx
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    //loop body
}
```

This is probably the most commonly used JavaScript looping construct. In order to understand how can we optimize its work, we need to dissect it a little bit.

### Dissection
The ```for``` loop consists of four parts: initialization, pretest condition, loop body, post-execute. The way it works is the followingâ€Š-â€Šfirst the initialization code is executed (var i = 0;), then the pretest condition (i < 10;). If the pretest condition evaluates to ```true```, then the body of the loop is executed and after that the post-execute code (i++) is run.

### Optimizations
The first step in optimizing the amount of work in a loop is to minimize the number of object member and array item lookups.

You can also increase the performance of loops by reversing their order. In JavaScript, reversing a loop does result in a small performance improvement for loops, provided that you eliminate extra operations as a result.

Both of the statements above are valid for the other two faster loops as well (```while``` and ```do-while```).

```jsx
// original loop
for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++){
    process(items[i]);
}
// minimizing property lookups
for (var i = 0, len = items.length; i < len; i++){
    process(items[i]);
}
// minimizing property lookups and reversing
for (var i = items.length; i--; ){
    process(items[i]);
}
```

## While Loop
The second type of loop is the ```while``` loop. This is simple pretest loop, consisted of pretest condition and a loop body.

```jsx
var i = 0;
while(i < 10){
    //loop body
    i++;
}
```

### Dissection
If the pretest condition evaluates to ```true```, the loop body is executed. If notâ€Š-â€Šit's skipped. Every ```while``` loop can be replaced with ```for``` and vice versa.

### Optimizations

```jsx
// original loop
var j = 0;
while (j < items.length){
    process(items[j++]);
}
// minimizing property lookups
var j = 0,
    count = items.length;
while (j < count){
    process(items[j++]);
}
// minimizing property lookups and reversing
var j = items.length;
while (j--){
    process(items[j]);
}
```
